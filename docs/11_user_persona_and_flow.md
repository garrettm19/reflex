## Daily User Flow

**Scenario:** It's 9:30 AM. Alex is sitting at his desk, preparing to trade NQ.

1. **Launches Reflex**
   - Mascot appears and greets Alex
   - Dashboard shows XP, streak count, and a reminder to stay disciplined

2. **Opens TradingView / NinjaTrader**
   - Scans for setups

3. **Logs a trade (or decides not to trade)**
   - If a trade is taken:
     - After the trade ends, Alex logs it using the Journal Entry form
     - Adds confluences, grades it, uploads a screenshot
     - Receives GPT feedback on discipline and entry quality
     - Mascot reacts (celebrates or advises)

   - If no trade is taken:
     - Alex logs a “No Trade Day”
     - Mascot encourages patience
     - XP is still rewarded to maintain streak

4. **Breaks a rule (optional path)**
   - Reflex detects it (e.g., 4th trade after max 3)
   - Mascot gives warning or blocks logging

5. **End of Day**
   - Alex reviews streak, rule compliance, XP earned
   - Optionally exports a snapshot of the day as a PDF
