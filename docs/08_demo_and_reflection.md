# Reflex – Demo and Reflection

## Final Project Summary

Reflex is a desktop application designed to help prop firm traders build discipline, log their trades, and prevent emotional errors through real-time feedback, AI insights, and gamification.

The application includes:
- A structured trade journaling system
- A mascot assistant that reacts to behavior
- Rule enforcement and violation tracking
- GPT-powered feedback on trades and habits
- An XP and badge-based streak system
- A behavioral “trading resume” export feature

---

## Demo Video

A walk-through of the working app is available at:  
[Insert Loom or YouTube link here]

This demo covers:
- Logging a trade and receiving GPT feedback
- Breaking a rule and seeing mascot warnings
- Viewing your streaks and XP progress
- Exporting the behavioral resume

---

## Screenshots

- `demo/dashboard_screenshot.png`: Daily dashboard with XP and prompt
- `demo/journal_entry_screenshot.png`: Trade journaling with grade and notes
- `demo/mascot_warning.png`: Mascot reacting to rule violation
- `demo/export_resume.png`: PDF export of behavioral summary

---

## Key Outcomes

- Fully functioning MVP scoped and built using SDLC
- Local-first journaling with real-time AI analysis
- Floating, animated mascot interface (Electron + Lottie)
- Thoughtful behavior reinforcement model
- Professional-grade documentation across all phases

---

## What I Learned

- How to plan, document, and build a product using professional SDLC phases
- How to separate behavior-based success from PnL-based tracking
- How to integrate OpenAI’s GPT API for structured feedback
- How to architect a local-first Electron + React app with transparent overlays
- How to apply real behavioral science and gamification in software

---

## What I Would Improve

- Add optional cloud sync or mobile companion
- Expand GPT integration to provide coaching patterns over months
- Add voice feedback with personalization
- Refine animation polish and mascot interactivity
- Integrate a challenge system (e.g., “No Revenge Week”)

---

## Final Statement

This project demonstrates the ability to design, architect, and build a complete product from a raw problem—following structured software development practices used by real-world product teams.

It is a practical, usable solution for real traders, and an example of building behavior-first software that solves a focused, emotional problem through thoughtful design and AI.
